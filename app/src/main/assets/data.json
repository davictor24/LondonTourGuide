Picture yourself as a guest at William and Kate’s wedding, when Prince Harry turned the throne room into a disco. Buy a ticket for a curated garden tour. It’s the biggest private garden in London and very beautiful, with a 400-year-old tree and 30 bird species. The Queen keeps queen bees and makes her own honey.

Byatt’s novel The Children’s Book, which is set in Edwardian London and which describes the ceramics in Rooms 140-146 in luscious, sumptuous detail. The museum always has that former empire vibe for me. The scones with cream and jam are pretty great in the downstairs cafe, which also feels very E.M. Forster. If you know a member, or decide to become one, you also get access to an amazing secret cafe hidden at the back of the glass collection.",

The silver-gilt huntsman automaton in the Waddesdon Bequest gallery is one of the most unusual items. This 17th century drinking game was propelled around a table by a clockwork mechanism with a removable head to drink from. Look out for secret doors in the beautiful and fascinating Enlightenment gallery.",
